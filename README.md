# halfpong
A pong game where you play against the wall

This is a simple game made mostly with canvas. You have a ball, a paddle, and some targets on the left side with 50, 20 and 100 points. Hit them and your score will increase, but so will the difficulty! So be careful. Oh, and you can push the paddle to the side to make it go faster. Hitting the blank space will barely give you 1 point.

The game does have some bugs mostly related to collision checking. Currently the ball may clip to the bottom and move right without collision check, so you will lose instantly. The ball may also slip through the paddle at some times when you try to push it.
